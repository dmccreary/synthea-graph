# Open Source Clinical Benchmarking Mission

The mission of our team is the following:

*Provide state-of-the-art clinical benchmarks to help stakeholders fairly understand the tradeoffs of using alternate representations of clinical data.*

Our values include:

* **Transparency** - we value not hiding any of the pros or cons of different architectures
* **Scalability** - we focus on not just small clinics and hospitals but analytics of the entire US patient populations
* **Inclusiveness** - we value the inputs to our benchmarks regardless of an organization's prior work or the race, gender or background of any individuals that would like to contribute to our site.  All are welcome here.
