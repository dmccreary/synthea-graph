# Sample Benchmarks

* Establishing the baseline performance for bringing an entire clinical record for a patent when there are millions of patients in the system
* Understanding the query performance impact of different representations of clinical data
* Understanding the performance impact of features such as enabling role-based access control
* Creating benchmarks for clinical queries
* Comparing the impact of new hardware and software on clinical systems
* Comparting graph queries to non-graph options
* Testing the performance and feasibility of new algorithms such as real-time fraud detection
