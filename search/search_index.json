The current version generates a patient record and related clinical information such as allergies, claims, diagnosis, prescriptions, vaccinations, etc. You can generate any arbitrary-sized patient population, you are only limited by the disk space on your servers. Typical Usage A typical use is the following command: $ synthea_run -p 10000 Which will generate 10 thousand sample patient records. The default format is FHIR, but we find that changing the config files to generate CSV files is more efficient. After the files are generated, you can use the tools in this repository to load this data into TigerGraph.","title":"Synthea to Graph"},{"location":"#synthea-to-graph","text":"This microsite is about the generation of synthetic clinical data and the loading of this data into a graph database such as TigerGraph The process of generating large collections of clinical graph data can be used for: Establishing the baseline performance for bringing an entire clinical record for a patent when there are millions of patients in the system Understanding the query performance impact of different representations of clinical data Understanding the performance impact of features such as enabling role-based access control Creating benchmarks for clinical queries Comparing the impact of new hardware and software on clinical systems Comparting graph queries to non-graph options Testing the performance and feasibility of new algorithms such as real-time fraud detection","title":"Synthea to Graph"},{"location":"#background","text":"Synthea is a tool for generating synthetic healthcare records.
